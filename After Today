They've been laughin' since I can remember
But they're not gonna laugh anymore
No more "Maxie the Geek"
No more "Goof of the Week" like before

No more algebra tests 'til September
No more lookin' at losers like him
No more havin' to cheat
No more mystery meat
No more gym
No more gym
No more gym
No more gym

Gonna move to the mall
Gonna live in the pool
Gonna talk to Roxanne and not feel like a fool

'Cause after today, I'm gonna be cruisin'
After today, she'll be mine
After today, my brains'll be snoozing
If I don't faint, I'll be fine

I've got forty more minutes of Home Economics
Then down with the textbooks
And up with the comics

Just think of all the time I've been losin'
Finding the right thing to say
But things'll be going my way after today

She looked right through me
And who could blame her?
I need a new me
Plus some positive proof that I'm not just a goof

And after today, I'm gonna be cruisin'
No more pep rallies to cut, blech!
After today, our brains'll be snoozing
I'm gonna sit on my butt

I've got less than an hour
And when this is ended
I'll either be famous
Or you'll be suspended!

Just think of all the time I've been losin'
Waiting until I could say
Gonna be on my own
Kiss the parents goodbye
Gonna party from now 'til the end of July
Things'll be going my way
After today

I wish that this was the day
After today
